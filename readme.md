● This is a price prediction model which predicts the cost of a house.
● This project contains all the data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc.
● The model is able to produce an accuracy of 80%.
● A typical user interface is developed to allow users to determine house costs based on various parameters. The interface is constructed using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.
